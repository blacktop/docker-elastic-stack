# logstash Configuration Files - Bro IDS Logs
# Created by 505Forensics (http://www.505forensics.com)
# MIT License, so do what you want with it!
#
# For use with logstash, elasticsearch, and kibana to analyze logs
#
# Usage: Reference this config file for your instance of logstash to parse Bro conn logs
#
# Limitations: Standard Bro log delimiter is tab.
#
# Dependencies: Utilizing the logstash 'translate' filter requires having the logstash contrib plugins added, which are community supported and not part of the official release. Visit logstash.net to find out how to install these
